Initial demo app as part of Udacity's UIKit Fundamentals course.

This is a very simple app used to illustrate basic UIKit concepts such as view objects, control objects, 
IBAction, IBOutlet, target action, etc. The app was built programmatically as a way to show the processes 
that storyboard performs when a user uses the interface builder in Xcode.
